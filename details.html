        <h2><center>Taj Mahal Uttar Pradesh</center></h2>
        <p>
          Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the
          Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his wife
          Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in
          1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their
          marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building,
          it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right)
          bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the
          right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj
          Mahal.
